Run the code to generate a realistic March Madness bracket. 
The results will be displayed based on the seed of the winning team. All four regions are separated. The teams in the Final Four have a letter attached to represent the division they came from to differentiate results where two teams of the same seed play each other.
The generator is based on historical data involving seeding alone. Seeding matchups that have never occurred before nor have enough data to make a reasonable prediction are determined by a hidden "strength" factor that favors better-seeded teams while always leaving a possibility for the lower-ranked team to pull off an upset.
Currently, the data has been collected from 2021 and earlier. There are no commands in this version.
